        <h2 class="secHeading">Exploring Sports</h2>
        <p class = "text">
          Sports are the heartbeat of human competition, where determination, skill, and passion converge. 
          From the roar of the crowd to the sweat on an athlete's brow, sports offer a canvas for dreams to flourish and champions to emerge.
          whether it's the grace of a figure skater, the power of a soccer striker, or the strategy of a chess grandmaster, each sport paints
          a unique tapestry of moments that inspire, entertain, and unite us. Sports transcend language and borders, forging connections that bridge divides and celebrate the extraordinary 
          in the ordinary. They remind us that in the arena of life, victory and defeat are mere chapters in a story of resilience, teamwork, and the enduring pursuit of excellence.

          <h2 class="desc">FOOTBALL</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Football, the world's most beloved sport, transcends borders and cultures, captivating hearts and minds with its simplicity and grace.
          Played on a lush green field, it's a battle of strategy and skill, where two teams of 11 players each aim to score by getting the ball into the opponent's net.
          The magic unfolds in 90 intense minutes, split into two halves, where players use their feet, heads, and chests to maneuver the ball.
          Only the goalkeeper can use their hands within the penalty area.
          <br></br>
          Fouls and free-kicks add drama, penalties create heart-pounding moments, and offside rules test precision. 
          From neighborhood matches to grand stadiums, football's allure is universal. The FIFA World Cup, held every four years, is the pinnacle of this beautiful game, uniting nations in a display of talent and passion. 
          Legends like Pel√©, Maradona, Ronaldo, and Messi have left an indelible mark, inspiring generations. Beyond the sport, football builds bridges, fostering camaraderie and a sense of belonging that resonates across the globe.

          <h2 class="desc">CRICKET</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Cricket, a bat-and-ball sport, is a beloved pastime and a cultural phenomenon in many countries, especially in India, England, Australia, and the West Indies. 
          Played between two teams of 11 players each, the objective is simple: score runs by hitting a ball and defending wickets. The bowler aims to dismiss 
          the batsmen while the batsmen try to accumulate runs through various shots.
          <br></br>
          Cricket offers different formats, including Test matches, One Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 (T20) matches, each with varying rules and durations. 
          Test matches are known for their endurance, lasting up to five days, while T20 matches are fast-paced and usually completed in around three hours.
          The sport has iconic events like the Cricket World Cup and The Ashes, and legendary players such as Sachin Tendulkar, Sir Don Bradman, and Sir Vivian Richards
          have left indelible marks on its history. Cricket's popularity extends beyond the field, often representing national pride and serving as a powerful cultural symbol.

          <h2 class="desc">BADMINTON</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Badminton is a fast-paced racquet sport played both recreationally and competitively around the world. 
          It's typically played indoors but can also be enjoyed outdoors in more casual settings. The game involves two or four players who use a shuttlecock,
          a feathered or plastic projectile, to score points by sending it over the net and into their opponent's side of the court.
          <br></br>
          The objective is to make the shuttlecock land in the opponent's court, either by hitting it over the net or forcing them to make an error. 
          Badminton demands agility, quick reflexes, and excellent hand-eye coordination. It's a sport that can be enjoyed by players of all ages and skill levels, 
          making it a popular choice for family gatherings and recreational outings. However, at the elite level, badminton is a highly competitive sport with fast rallies, powerful smashes,
          and strategic play, making it an exciting spectator sport as well.

        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Martial arts encompass a diverse range of combat practices and disciplines that have origins in various cultures around the world.
          They emphasize physical fitness, self-discipline, and mental focus. While some martial arts, like karate and judo, originated in Japan, others like kung fu hail from China, 
          and Brazilian jiu-jitsu has its roots in Brazil. Each martial art has its unique techniques, philosophies, and training methods.
          Practitioners of martial arts, known as martial artists, undergo rigorous training to master strikes, kicks, throws, and grappling techniques.
          They often adhere to a code of ethics that promotes respect, humility, and self-control. Many people practice martial arts for self-defense, physical fitness, and personal development.
          <br></br>
          Competitive martial arts, such as MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) and Olympic Taekwondo, have gained popularity as spectator sports. 
          These events showcase the skills and athleticism of martial artists in a controlled, regulated environment. Beyond sport and self-defense, martial arts offer a path to personal growth,
          building character, and fostering a sense of community among its practitioners.
